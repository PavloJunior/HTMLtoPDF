<p>We write web development software since ~20 years, we used Perl, PHP, Python, C#, and Java during the first 13 years of our existence. Now for the last 7 years, we decided to focus on our favorite language which is Ruby. A language which has one of the greatest MVC frameworks, which was a pattern for all other newer MVC frameworks in PHP, Java or C#. We are talking about <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> of course.</p>
<h2 id="mvc-or-not-to-mvc">MVC or not to MVC?</h2>
<p>But if Ruby on Rails or even whole MVC pattern is a <strong>silver bullet</strong> for each web application?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>That is an excellent tool for starting new applications, that have to be <strong>delivered fast</strong> and be <strong>reliable</strong>.</p>
<p>And that is great. Ruby community has grown a lot because of that. As a community, we shipped thousands of applications in a really short period.</p>
<p>And as a community which has a lot of successful applications, we encountered another challenge. Develop those applications, add a lot of <strong>complex features</strong>, model long <strong>business process</strong> and handle all its <strong>edge-cases</strong>. Maintain that, and write it in a really <strong>explicit way</strong> so new developers can be easily implemented into our big legacy projects.</p>
<p>And then our community was like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Man, I don’t like rails way anymore”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of great conferences was only about “how we should change rails way so we can still have fun and joy during developing our applications?”.</p>
<p>Few people were like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“F*ck that, let’s switch to functional programming”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, probably with applications where each millisecond is really important they were mostly right.</p>
<h2 id="when-and-how-to-replace-mvc">When and how to replace MVC?</h2>
<p>But there was also a lot of people who were like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Yea, rails way have its disadvantages, but we know which one. Let’s try to change some approaches to convert those parts of our frameworks to advantages”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those people created a few new “frameworks”, “libraries” or “approaches”. Name it as you like.</p>
<p>The thing is, after those years and testing a lot of solutions, we found <strong>Trailblazer</strong> a great tool for complex applications. Why? That series won’t be about it but there you have some great articles about Trailblazer, and why you should consider it in some of your projects:</p>

<h2 id="problem-with-traiblazer">Problem with Traiblazer</h2>
<p>But when you know that you want to use TRB and you know why, you will encounter quite an important problem. There is not a lot of detailed <strong>tutorials</strong> about how to start with TRB. Even though it doesn’t have to be a big deal - we can refactor our existing application in ‘step by step’ strategy without diving into all Trailblazer details at once.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>So in a co-operation with <strong>Trailblazer</strong> core-team, we are starting tutorial called <em>“Refactor your legacy Rails app into shiny Trailblazer application”</em>.
